# TODO

Deferred work — not blocking the current iOS submission, but needed before specific future milestones. Each item names its trigger so it's clear when it becomes urgent.

## Android release signing

**Trigger:** before any Play Store submission (internal track, beta, or production). Not needed for iOS-only releases.

**Status:** `android/app/build.gradle.kts` currently signs `release` builds with the **debug keystore**. Play Store will reject any AAB signed with debug keys. We can run Android in debug locally and produce unsigned/debug builds today, but `flutter build appbundle --release` produces an artifact that's not Play-acceptable.

**Steps when ready (~20 min total):**

1. **Generate upload keystore (human, ~5 min).** This step is interactive and security-critical — passwords and the keystore file must not pass through Claude.
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/sakina-upload-keystore.jks \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias sakina-upload
   ```
   Pick strong distinct passwords for the store and the key. Write them somewhere durable (1Password / secure vault). **Losing this keystore permanently blocks app updates on Play Store** — there is no recovery path short of Google Play App Signing's reset flow (which requires you to have enrolled in App Signing in the first place).

2. **Back up the keystore file twice** (1Password attachment + encrypted drive, or whichever two-place strategy you trust). Same logic: gone = bricked.

3. **Wire up build (Claude can do, ~10 min):**
   - Create `android/key.properties` (gitignored) with `storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`.
   - Edit `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to read `key.properties` and add `signingConfigs.create("release")` pointed at it.
   - Switch `buildTypes.release.signingConfig` from `signingConfigs.getByName("debug")` to `signingConfigs.getByName("release")`.
   - Add `android/key.properties` and `*.jks` to `.gitignore`.

4. **Verify (Claude can do):** `flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define-from-file=env.json` produces a signed AAB. Inspect with `jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

5. **(Optional but recommended) Enroll in Google Play App Signing** in Play Console → Setup → App integrity. Upload your upload-key certificate (`.pem` extracted from the keystore). Play then re-signs the AAB with its own managed signing key for distribution, and you can reset the upload key if it's ever compromised. This is the canonical Android signing setup as of 2026.

**Until then:** Android dev/debug builds work as-is. Don't run `flutter build appbundle --release` and expect it to be Play-ready.

## OpenAI Edge Function proxy

**Trigger:** before any external TestFlight build (i.e. handing the build to anyone outside your Apple ID's individual testers) or App Store release.

**Status:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` is currently a `String.fromEnvironment` compile-time constant injected via `env.json`. It's baked into the Dart snapshot in the signed IPA — harder to extract than a plain text asset, but `strings` / Hopper / Ghidra on an extracted IPA still recovers it. **A bad actor with one IPA can drain OpenAI credit.**

**Plan exists at:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-openai-edge-function-proxy.md`

**Summary of work (Claude can do most, you need to do the key rotation + secret config):**

1. **Assume the key is compromised. Rotate it in OpenAI dashboard before doing anything else.** Old key stays valid until you rotate — if the new IPA ever ships before rotation, the old key is in the wild forever.
2. Create Supabase Edge Function `openai-proxy` (auth-gated, validates user JWT, proxies to OpenAI Chat Completions).
3. Store the new key as a Supabase Edge Function secret (never in `env.json`).
4. Update all 5 `ai_service.dart` call sites (lines 451, 607, 896, 1016, 1335) to call the proxy instead of OpenAI directly.
5. Drop `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `env.json`, `env.example.json`, and `lib/core/env.dart`.
6. Verify in TestFlight build that AI features still work; verify with `strings` that the key is no longer in the IPA.

**Why this is the right design:** mirrors the proven `revenuecat-webhook` pattern. The function runs server-side, holds the key in its server-side env, and the client just sends authenticated requests. RLS / auth gating prevents abuse by unauthenticated callers. Standard OWASP API security pattern.

## Supabase HIBP leaked-password protection

**Trigger:** if/when you upgrade to Supabase Pro plan or above.

**Status:** Supabase Auth has a built-in HaveIBeenPwned integration that rejects compromised passwords at signup/password-change. It's **gated to Pro+ plans** — not available on Free. The advisor warning (`auth_leaked_password_protection`) will keep firing on Free; safe to ignore until upgrade.

**Action when upgrading:** Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Policies → toggle on "Leaked Password Protection." 30-second change, no migration needed.
